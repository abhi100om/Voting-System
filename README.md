# 🗳️ Blockchain-Based Voting System

A secure and tamper-proof voting platform built using **Flask**, a **Python-based blockchain**, and a web-based admin panel. Designed for transparency and trust, each vote is recorded immutably on a local blockchain with features like candidate management, voting period control, and live results display.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Secure Voting** — Voter IDs are hashed using SHA-256.
- ⛓️ **Blockchain Integrity** — Each vote is stored as a verifiable block.
- 🧑‍💼 **Admin Panel** — Add candidates and set voting dates.
- 📊 **Live Results** — Real-time vote count and status.
- 🧾 **Audit Trail** — Internal log of system events.
- 🌐 **Simple UI** — Clean and responsive interface with Tailwind CSS.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

| Area        | Tools & Libraries                     |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Backend     | Python, Flask, SHA-256, requests       |
| Frontend    | HTML, Tailwind CSS, Jinja2 templates   |
| Blockchain  | Custom Python blockchain               |
| Optional    | Solidity (`Voting.sol` for future dApp) |

## 📦 How It Works

1. **User visits** the home page and casts their vote.
2. **Voter ID is hashed** and validated for uniqueness.
3. **Vote is recorded** on the custom blockchain.
4. **Admin** manages candidates and voting dates via panel.
5. **Results page** shows real-time voting tally.
